# git fresh-up
This repository is meant to hold links and information to the short git fresh-up presentation.

## presentation
The [presentation] shows three catch-phrases in the work with git

- commit often
- perfect later
- publish once

## focus of this repo
This repo's main-focus is to feed the *perfect-later* with some hands-on.

The idea is to show how to efficiently rebase/squash commits of a cluttered branch before releasing it to the public (i.e. a non-feature-branch).
